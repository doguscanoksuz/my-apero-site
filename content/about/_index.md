I consider myself a Data Scientist and Psycholinguist. I have a passion for uncovering patterns in complex data using advanced statistical modelling, and for effectively communicating complex quantitative ideas in an accessible way. I value open science and enjoy building transparent, reusable code in R and Python.

As a Psycholinguist, I am fascinated by how the mind and brain acquire and process (multiple!) novel languages. I am particularly interested in the following four questions:

(a) How do monolingual and bilingual speakers mentally represent and process words and phrases?  
(b) What role does frequency play in language learning and comprehension?  
(c) How do individual differences shape language learning and bilingual cognition?  
(d) How do learning mechanisms adapt to the diverse statistical properties of typologically distinct languages?

I see science and statistics as fundamentally inseparable — you cannot do one without the other. That’s why I invest considerable time in developing teaching materials and content aimed at providing a solid statistical foundation for social scientists — often spending my weekends on it!
